So you may be wondering why I have 2 types of forms in this documentation... In all honesty, I was just following the guys that created shadcn-vue lol.

The components created here is how I usually go about creating form elements to be used in my projects. I use the composition API provided by `vee-validate` to compose my reusable form elements and then use the `useForm` composable to do the validation with either `zod` or `yup` schemas.

## Getting Started

:::Steps
::Step

### Installation

In order to get this to work in your app, you will need to install the [Vee-Validate Nuxt Module](https://vee-validate.logaretm.com/v4/integrations/nuxt/)

```bash
npm i @vee-validate/nuxt
```

::
::Step

### Add Validation Library

You will also need a library that will be used to perform validation.

Since `vee-validate` supports `zod`, `yup`, `valibot` and `joi`, you can choose any of these libraries to perform validation.

#### Zod

```bash
npm i zod @vee-validate/zod
```

#### Yup

```bash
npm i yup @vee-validate/yup
```

#### Valibot

```bash
npm i valibot @vee-validate/valibot
```

#### Joi

```bash
npm i joi @vee-validate/joi
```

::
::Step

### Update Nuxt Config

After that, we will need to add the `@vee-validate/nuxt` module to our `nuxt.config.js` file.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  //...
  modules: ["@vee-validate/nuxt"],
  //...
});
```
