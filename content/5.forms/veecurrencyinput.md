## Source code

Click :SourceCodeLink{component="Vee/CurrencyInput.vue"} to see the source code for this component on GitHub. Feel free to copy it and adjust it for your own use.

## Installation

```bash
npx ui-thing@latest add vee-currency-input
```

## Usage

### User form

In the form below, we are using the `useForm` composition function provided by Vee-Validate to handle the form submission and validation. The `useForm` composable accepts a `validationSchema` option that we can use to define our validation rules. We are using the `zod` library to define our validation rules. You can use any validation library you want as long as it is supported by Vee-Validate and can be passed to the `toTypedSchema` function.

  import { z } from "zod";

  const schema = z.object({
    toys: z

        invalid_type_error: "The toys total must be a number",
        required_error: "The toys total is required",

  const onSubmit = handleSubmit(async (values) => {
    const promise = () => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));
    useSonner.promise(promise, {
      loading: "Making payment...",
      success: (d) => "Payment successful!",
      error: (e) => "Error! Your information could not be sent to our servers!",
    });
